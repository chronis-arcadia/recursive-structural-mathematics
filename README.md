# Recursive Structural Mathematics (RSM‑Lab)

This repository hosts the public artefacts for **Recursive Structural Mathematics
(RSM)**—a framework that re‑defines truth as *structural survival under recursive
compression*.

## Directory layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/primer.md` | Conceptual overview (Primer) |
| `docs/entropy_Ex.md` | Definition of the entropy metric **E(x)** |
| `docs/vec_drift.md` | Vector‑Drift Classification Engine spec |
| `docs/media/` | Auto‑extracted images referenced by the above documents |

> **Note**: Equations are currently PNGs (pandoc extraction).  A LaTeX
> replacement backlog will be opened as an issue.

## How to read

1. Start with **`docs/primer.md`** for the big‑picture rationale.  
2. Jump to **`docs/entropy_Ex.md`** to see how entropy is measured.  
3. Finish with **`docs/vec_drift.md`** for drift detection mechanics.

That’s it for the alpha drop—code demos and datasets will be added in
subsequent commits.
